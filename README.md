# Img-Noise-Reduction

Using Autoencoders from **Tensorflow's Keras** library, to **de-noise** the sample images, with a high accuracy.

## Dataset 

I imported the famously-used MNIST dataset from keras, and added noise to the images for the denoising process.

## Libraries used

* I used Keras to build the autoencoder.

* Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML.
