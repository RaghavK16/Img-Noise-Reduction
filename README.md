# Img-Noise-Reduction

![Noise_Red](https://github.com/raghavk16/Img-Noise-Reduction/blob/master/Denoise.png?raw=true)


Using Autoencoders from **Tensorflow's Keras** library, to **de-noise** the sample images, with a high accuracy.

## Dataset 

I imported the famously-used MNIST dataset from keras, and added noise to the images for the denoising process.

## Libraries used

* I used Keras to build the autoencoder. Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML.

* Matplotlib.pyplot for displaying visualizations in project. It's an object-oriented plotting library.

* Numpy for mathematical operations on the data.

## Reference

* I gained a lot of insights about autoencoders from an article by Will Badr. Click [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/auto-encoder-what-is-it-and-what-is-it-used-for-part-1-3e5c6f017726) to read.
